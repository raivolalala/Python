Personal scripts
================

Note that scripts here are made solely for my own purposes, so take your
own chances.

Note
----

Since I am using Linux, scripts start with headers:

    #!/usr/bin/python3

..or these kind of headers:

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

These might require removing if You plan to use them on a different OS.
